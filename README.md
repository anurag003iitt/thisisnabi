ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nabi Karampour, a senior software engineer at Alibaba, Where I maintain financial-service systems based on the .NET Platform.

Beyond my role at Alibaba, I have an unwavering passion for development and am an active member of the thriving .NET community.

ASP.NET Core from Microsoft has my full attention, and I love sharing my insights through extensive blogging here.

Engaging with the .NET community, I frequently speak at conferences and user groups in Iran. 
If you're organizing an event, feel free to reach out â€” I'd be thrilled to be part of it.

I'm the founder of the `Be a .NET Expert` user group, dedicated to bringing captivating speakers and discussions to our local developer community.

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me indulging in my other passions: driving, swimming, and enjoying life in Tehran, Iran, with my wonderful wife.
